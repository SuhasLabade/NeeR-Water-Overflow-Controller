# NeeR-Water Overflow Controller


### Introduction: 
India's water crisis is often attributed to lack of government planning, increasedcorporate privatization, industrial and ##human waste and government corruption. 
In addition, water scarcity in India is expected to worsen as the overall population is expected 
to increase to 1.6 billion by year 2050. - The water project 

Focusing on human water waste problems - most of city areas wasting water every 
day while filling tanks. Roof top water storage tanks are obeserved to be overflowing many times in city area as well as in rural part of India.That tends to water scarcity problems and loss of energy.
This project aims to resolve water tank overflow problem and saves water and energy wastage. 


### Need : 

This one is news in Hindustan times regarding water crisis in New Delhi. Governement annonucing fine of Rs. 2000/- if water tank overflows.

Also in this journal its stated that - The quantum of water loss of an overflowing tank is estimated using theoretical analysis and experimental methods.
And by a survey of a colony on overflow, it was found out that 7% of the water supplied was lost; and additionally 3.84% of the
energy supplied was also lost; in one of the two colonies of Delhi.

This study also says that if any automatic cutoff controller is introduced then around 90 billion litres of treated water 
and 90 billion kW-hr of energy can be saved in a month in India. This clearly indicates potential and actual need of this project.
Currently these water controllers available in market but not in robust form and in affrodable price.
